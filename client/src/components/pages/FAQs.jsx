      <p>Q: How much time do you need to set up?</p>
      <p>A: I like to arrive one hour before the event starts, so I can make sure everything is set up and do a sound check.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: Can you provide an iPod/DJ service before and between your sets?</p>
      <p>A: Absolutely, I can keep music playing between sets</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: Can I pick the pieces you play from the set list?</p>
      <p>A: Absolutely, I'm happy for your set list to be curated however you choose.
You can pick any number of the songs from my song list.
Alternatively, if you give me a few artists/genres you like then I can curate your set list from there.

I'm always happy to chat through anything so we can find the perfect set list!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: Can you learn specific pieces before the event?</p>
      <p>A: If a song isn't included in my song list, I am happy to learn up to two new songs for your event free of charge.
      If you would like me to learn more than two there will be an extra fee, which was can discuss depending on the number of extra songs.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: Do you bring all the equipment you need to perform?</p>
      <p>A: Yes, of course! I will bring my own microphone, leads and an amp. All I require is a plug socket!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: 
      What if my timings change after I've booked you?</p>
      <p>A: I will always try my best to be flexible to help ensure your event runs as smoothly as possible. If timings change slightly in the run up to the event just let me know and I'm sure I can accommodate this for you</p>
      <br />
      <p>Q: Which artists have you been most influenced by?</p>
      <p>A: My influences range from Amy Winehouse, to Adele, to Yebba</p>
